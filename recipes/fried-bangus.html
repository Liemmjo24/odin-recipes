  <h2>Fried Bangus or Fried milkfish is a simple dish that is packed with flavors. <br>
      The milkfish alone has its deliciously rich taste (especially the belly) while the marinade gives it a sour spicy flavor.
  </h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
    <div class="border">
      <li>1 large boneless bangus milkfish; scales removed, cleaned and butterflied</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white vinegar</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic crushed</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup cooking oil</li>
    </div>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <div class="border">
          <li>Combine vinegar, garlic, and salt in a bowl. Stir.</li>
          <li>In a deep wide plate, pour-in the mixture and then lay down the fish in a 
          manner that the sliced part is facing down (skin should face up). 
          Cover and place in the fridge. Marinate for 8 to 12 hours.</li>
          <li>Heat the cooking oil in a pan. Fry both sides of the bangus in medium heat until the color turns medium brown <br>
          (note: it should take around 5 minutes per side). 
          <br>Note: the oil has a tendency to splatter because of the liquid from the marinade. 
          <br>Make sure to cover the pan while leaving open a small space for the steam to escape.</li>
          <li>Serve with spiced vinegar (Optional)</li>
